Scavenger

Jack Wiebe, Anselmo Rodrigues & Timothy Fernando

High Concept
A side-scroller shooting game that requires the character to destroy enemies and use their remaining parts to build additional weapons and ammunition. The setting is a debris belt in space in the distant future. The player is on the run from the space mafia and must use everything they can use to escape their clutches

Unique Features
•	Upgrades are obtained by defeating enemies and/or destroying supply crates
•	Stronger weapons are limited by a cooldown which can be lowered by picking up scrap from destroyed enemies
•	If the Player dies all upgrades it has are lost but are scattered in the screen as parts. These can be collected once again when the players spawns again
•	The Player can also collect enough scrap to get an additional ship

Game Features
This game is a single player campaign. Players collect scrap and other upgrades to build up their ship as they try to reach the goal of every level. The player’s ship retains all of its upgrades between levels. Enemies come in from all sides of the screen. As soon as the player is destroyed and has no remaining ships, they receive a game over
